# Task 4 – Password Security & Authentication Analysis

## Internship Domain
Cyber Security

## Task Objective
The objective of this task is to understand how passwords are stored, how attackers attempt to crack them, and how strong authentication mechanisms help in protecting systems from unauthorized access.

## Tools Studied
- Hashcat
- John the Ripper
- Online Hash Identifiers

## Concepts Covered
- Password hashing vs encryption
- Common hash types (MD5, SHA-1, bcrypt)
- Password hash generation
- Dictionary attack
- Brute-force attack
- Weak password analysis
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

## Methodology
1. Studied how passwords are securely stored using hashing.
2. Identified different hashing algorithms and their strengths.
3. Generated password hashes using different methods.
4. Understood dictionary and brute-force attack techniques.
5. Analyzed why weak passwords fail quickly.
6. Studied the importance of Multi-Factor Authentication.

## Analysis
- Weak passwords are vulnerable to dictionary and brute-force attacks.
- Older hashing algorithms like MD5 and SHA-1 are insecure.
- Strong hashing algorithms like bcrypt improve password security.
- MFA provides an additional security layer even if a password is compromised.

## Recommendations
- Use long and complex passwords.
- Avoid password reuse.
- Use strong hashing algorithms like bcrypt.
- Enable Multi-Factor Authentication wherever possible.

## Learning Outcome
This task improved understanding of password security, common attack techniques, and modern authentication practices used to protect systems.

## Conclusion
Strong password policies and multi-factor authentication are essential for cyber security. Understanding password attacks helps in designing more secure systems.
